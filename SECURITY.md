# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch. If you need a patch for an older commit, open an issue and we'll discuss options.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

Preferred:
- Open a GitHub Security Advisory (if enabled on the repo).

Fallback:
- Open a GitHub issue with the prefix `[SECURITY]` and clearly state you want to coordinate a private fix.

Please do not disclose security issues publicly until a fix is available and released.
